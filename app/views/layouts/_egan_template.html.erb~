Those who misunderstand the primary objective of doing good (their own qualification for existence) think doing good is intended for others (selflessness). They then use morality as law and force others to submit to it. They reason that everyone alive owes them morality and must be good to them lest they become criminals. Most of these immoral selfless preachers will go as far as subduing entire nations and force them to live according to some fixed moral code of theirs. While they preach the end of the world and hellfire that is meant to punish those who do not see things through their eyes, they contradict themselves by inflicting them punishment before the judgement day they speak about. They constitute a fatal threat to universal existence. Their presence in the vicinity is heralded by endless war and strife.

Love

Note that I cover the topic, in the &#39;Man&#39; book in the section entitled &#39;Free will answers the most complicated questions about life&#39;.
Definition:
  - I say that something is of &#39;the mind kind&#39;, if it is based on the pattern of thinking, that is, on the convictions, beliefs and views that one holds in their mind, but only in the case where every action in the real world can be traced back to the pattern of thinking in one&#39;s mind.
 
    
Love is &#39;the bondage that exists between like-minded  beings whose actions fully comply with their mind&#39;.  The services they trade to one another in that bondage will then typify the love, making it either sensual (lovers), brotherly or friendly.

That explains why you most certainly end up hating  someone if you bonded with them on any other basis  than their mind. So, learn to like people&#39;s way of thinking, first. Then check whether their  thoughts are true or not (the most difficult).  Finally, check whether they are loyal to their  thoughts in their daily actions.

What about when your heart goes out to total strangers in  their adversity? It is triggered by love you have developed for some principle, like, &#39;we owe everything to somebody out there,  so using what we have to help others is the logical effect of that fact&#39;. Such qaulities as mercy, loving kindness, must result from the kind of love I&#39;ve defined. The other way around (love that results from mercy)  will make it fake, eventually. So if you ever  feel merciful, ask yourself if it&#39;s coming from  love, otherwise people will deceive you.

Note that love cannot be isolated. It must be  balanced with wisdom and justice, for it to remain  true (real).

That being said, the most powerful and lasting bondage is of the mind kind. The natural love that one has for their  parents (and vice-versa) or their siblings is the weakest  of all. Proof is you end up falling in love with somebody you have not known your whole life and love them more than your parents and siblings, if the mutual attraction is of the mind kind (i.e., you fell for the contents of their mind and their devotion to it in the real life).

So bonds that exist between friends, marriage partners, fellow believers, if they are of the mind kind, are the most powerful and long-lasting. Note that I willingly omit such point as whether one&#39;s pattern of thinking, followed by actions, is correct or not. That is where true love or fake love comes into picture. If you bond with someone on the basis of wrong views you hold in common, it&#39;s fake love and it will only bring troubles.
